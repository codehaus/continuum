o getting all the dependencies correctly aggregated for the container to use
 for th runtime.

o having to manually keep the component descriptors up-to-date. 

o anything user configurable must use the new mode of placing the
  configuration in a space that makes it easily changed ... or make
  a little administration console like Joe ... that would kick ass.

o need the runtime builder

o need the CDC fully working

o how to easily make changes to the app during development

o a console for configuring during runtime would rock

o process a combination of serialized configurations taken during runtime and
  values in the XML configuration.
  
o how to validate the component.xml ... most problems would be alleviated
with the use of the CDC.
