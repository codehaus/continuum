/**
 * A simple non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock.
 * The lock is free upon construction. Each acquire gets the
 * lock, and each release frees it. Releasing a lock that
 * is already free has no effect.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation makes no attempt to provide any fairness
 * or ordering guarantees. If you need them, consider using one of
 * the Semaphore implementations as a locking mechanism.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Sample usage</b><br>
 * <p/>
 * Mutex can be useful in constructions that cannot be
 * expressed using java synchronized blocks because the
 * acquire/release pairs do not occur in the same method or
 * code block. For example, you can use them for hand-over-hand
 * locking across the nodes of a linked list. This allows
 * extremely fine-grained locking,  and so increases
 * potential concurrency, at the cost of additional complexity and
 * overhead that would normally make this worthwhile only in cases of
 * extreme contention.
 * <pre>
 * class Node {
 *   Object item;
 *   Node next;
 *   Mutex lock = new Mutex(); // each node keeps its own lock
 * <p/>
 *   Node(Object x, Node n) { item = x; next = n; }
 * }
 * <p/>
 * class List {
 *    protected Node head; // pointer to first node of list
 * <p/>
 *    // Use plain java synchronization to protect head field.
 *    //  (We could instead use a Mutex here too but there is no
 *    //  reason to do so.)
 *    protected synchronized Node getHead() { return head; }
 * <p/>
 *    boolean search(Object x) throws InterruptedException {
 *      Node p = getHead();
 *      if (p == null) return false;
 * <p/>
 *      //  (This could be made more compact, but for clarity of illustration,
 *      //  all of the cases that can arise are handled separately.)
 * <p/>
 *      p.lock.acquire();              // Prime loop by acquiring first lock.
 *                                     //    (If the acquire fails due to
 *                                     //    interrupt, the method will throw
 *                                     //    InterruptedException now,
 *                                     //    so there is no need for any
 *                                     //    further cleanup.)
 *      for (;;) {
 *        if (x.equals(p.item)) {
